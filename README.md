# Pokédex Project

This Pokédex was created 6 months into my coding journey. It showcases my early skills in web development, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display Pokémon data, search for specific Pokémon, and navigate between them.

This project exclusively features Generation 5 Pokémon from the Unova region. As a passion project, it holds a special place for me, as I grew up with Pokémon and have always been a fan of the series.

## Features

- **Pokémon Data Display**: View detailed information about Pokémon, including their stats and more.
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find Pokémon by name with a dynamic search that filters results.
- **Navigation**: Easily browse between Pokémon using 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and layout of the Pokédex.
- **CSS3**: Styling to bring the project to life.
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity and data handling.

## Future Improvements

As I continue to grow my skills, this project will serve as a benchmark for progress. Future enhancements might include more advanced features like animations, improved UI, and adding more Pokémon generations.
